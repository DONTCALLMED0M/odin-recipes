    <h2>Tastes very much like the famous honey baked ham but costs much less!</h2>
    <p>Whether you're cooking for a special occasion or you just want to treat yourself to a delicious dinner, you can't go wrong with a honey-glazed ham.
      <br>
        This simple recipe is easy to make the day-of and will impress everyone at your table.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ham: This recipe calls for one 5-pound ready-to-eat ham. If your ham is larger or smaller, you'll need to adjust the recipe.</li>
        <li>Cloves: Aromatic whole cloves add warm, spicy-sweet flavor.</li>
        <li>Honey: Of course, you'll need honey.</li>
        <li>Corn Syrup: Dark corn syrup adds more flavor and contributes to caramelization.</li>
        <li>Butter: Butter adds and helps retain moisture, resulting in a juicy honey-baked ham that's impossible to resist.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Score ham, and stud with the whole cloves. Place ham in foil lined pan.</li>
        <li>In the top half of a double boiler, heat the corn syrup, honey and butter. Keep glaze warm while baking ham.</li>
        <li>Brush glaze over ham, and bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes in the preheated oven.</li>
        <li>Baste ham every 10 to 15 minutes with the honey glaze. During the last 4 to 5 minutes of baking, turn on broiler to caramelize the glaze. Remove from oven, and let sit a few minutes before serving.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
